# Magia Borras [WIP]
##### By Cristichi
Magia Borras is just a mod I have been doing in order to practice modding on Minecraft (with Fabric). Since I like Harry Potter (the universe more than anything), I thought of using this opportunity for doing a mod with HP's Spells and thematic. 
The name comes from an old [children's toy](https://www.magiaborras.com/) to teach children to perform some classic magic tricks.

## Characteristics
The mod includes a variety of elements from the Harry Potter universe.

### Wands
Your Wand is an elemental part of your magical equipment. In Harry Potter's universe,
wands are almost like an extension of any witch or wizard. The wand chooses the
witch/wizard, so a wand will prove more useful for the witch or wizard it chose.

In Magia Borras, a Wand is a craftable Item you can craft using Moonstone, a new Ore.
Each Wand is more or less powerful depending on the Player that wields it. Keep
crafting Wands and testing them until you see fireworks, cherry leaves or even the
Ender Dragon's breath, which are indicators or Wands that are good with you.

You need a Wand in order to cast Spells, and you can prepare a Wand to cast each
specific Spell by using the command `/magia set <Spell>`. One a Wand has a Spell
prepared, it keeps that Spell prepared until it is changed again with the same
command. If you give your Wand with a Spell to another Player, or you save it on
a chest, or if you throw it away, it will also keep the Spell.

### Spells
Spells are the most essential part of this mod. During your adventure in Minecraft,
you will be able to discover and/or craft special Spell Books. Each Spell Book has
a specific Spell inside, of the many available in the mod, and you can consume the
Spell Book to learn that Spell. Once a Player learns a Spell, he will see it when
typing the `/magia set <Spell>` command and he will be able to use that Spell when
using a Wand with that Spell prepared.

## Releases
A release may be available as soon as the project has all the features and is 
properly tested with everything, even if only to share with my friends.
