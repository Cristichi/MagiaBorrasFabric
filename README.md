# Magia Borras [WIP]
##### By Cristichi
Magia Borras is just a mod I have been doing in order to practice modding on Minecraft (with Fabric). Since I like Harry Potter (the universe more than anything), I thought of using this opportunity for doing a mod with HP's Spells and thematic. 
The name comes from an old [children's toy](https://www.magiaborras.com/) to teach children to perform some classic magic tricks.

## Characteristics
The mod includes a variety of elements from the Harry Potter universe.

### Wands
Your Wand is an elemental part of your magical equipment. In Harry Potter's universe, wands are almost like an extension of any witch or wizard. The wand chooses the witch/wizard, so a wand will prove more useful for the witch or wizard it chose.

In Magia Borras, a Wand is a craftable Item you can craft using Moonstone, a new Ore. Each Wand is more or less powerful depending on the Player that wields it. Keep crafting Wands and testing them until you see fireworks, cherry leaves or even the Ender Dragon's breath, which are indicators of Wands that have a good synergy with you.

You need a Wand in order to cast Spells by using right click to cast the prepared Spell or you can also configure keys to quick cast any specific Spell. You can prepare a Wand to cast each specific Spell by pressing the configured key for it (`R` by default). Once a Wand has a Spell prepared, it keeps that Spell prepared until it is changed in the same way. If you give your Wand with a Spell to another Player, or you save it on a chest, or if you throw it to the ground, it will also keep the Spell.

### Spells
Spells are the most essential part of this mod. During your adventure in Minecraft, you will be able to discover and/or craft special Spell Books that you can use to learn the related Spell. Simply craft a Spell Book, put it into your hand and right click. This will allow you to learn the Spell for the rest of your adventure. Make sure you do not waste materials on crafting a Spell Book you already learned!

Here is the list of Spells from the latest release of the mod, v1.0.13:

* Accio: It pulls any Entity towards you. This includes Players, Mobs, and even items on the ground!
* Alohomora: This Spell opens any door or trapdoor, including iron ones.
* ArrestoMomentum: Stop all Entities around you from falling for a moment.
* Ascendio: It pushes you up. Be careful with those knees, though.
* Avada Kedavra: It kills any living entity hit. Please test it with some practice Armor Stands first.
* Bombarda: Dangerous Spell that creates an explosion on the Entity or Block you are looking at. Easily blow your house from the inside for free!
* Depulso: Pushes any Entity.
* Diffindo: Simple damage Spell. It deals a basic amount of damage but has also very little cooldown. Very good in general to keep Mobs in check.
* Expelliarmus: Amusing Spell that throws the item in from the hand of Players and Mobs. Quite good against Skeletons.
* Incendio: FIREEEEEEEEEEE. Make sure your house if not made of wood.
* Lumos: It toggles the Wand's light. No harm on keeping it ON all the time.
* Protego: It protects you for the next short amount of time against any Spell. It does not protect you from fire or explosions, but it will protect you from being the exact target.
* Revelio: Upon use, it will make all entities around you glow. Useful to find sneakers, or easily see all items on the ground.
* Vermillious: Simple Spell that merely throws red particles in the direction you are looking.
* Wingardium Leviosa: It makes the target Entity levitate for a short amount of time. You can chain it with another to keep the levitation active.
